# Using API Manager to Solve a Real-world Problem

# Introduction

Union Station is a major multimodal railway transportation hub. It is one of the busiest stations in the country and serves more than thousands of passengers a day. The train shed, platforms and tracks are owned by GOGO transit, and they operate the station. Trains are owned by the companies named Quantis, ColTrain and RailCo. To provide a digital ecosystem, all four companies are planning to develop their day to day business operations with WSO2 technology. These development ranges from providing different kinds of APIs to external/internal users, providing real time notifications, stream data processing, integrating with partners/external systems etc.

This tutorial will demonstrate how WSO2 technology can be used to cater to their different  requirements.

# Background and Setup

# Create REST API using OpenAPI definition

###User Story: 

**Coltrain is one of the railway companies that is partnered up with GOGO Train to provide better service to their customers. Coltrain already has some internally managed APIs deployed in-house and these are managed by their internal development team. One of the APIs is train schedule retrieval API which is intended for the public community to get the Coltrain schedules. Currently, this API is exposed for the public and Coltrain development team faces challenges in maintaining and handling high load for the API.**


By exposing this API through WSO2 API Manager, Coltrain expects to get the full benefits of an API Management solution such as API lifecycle management, security, throttling,etc. and decouple the maintenance overhead from the internal teams.
